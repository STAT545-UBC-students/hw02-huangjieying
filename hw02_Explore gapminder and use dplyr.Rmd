Load the data
```{r}
install.packages("gapminder")
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

#Smell test the data
gapminder is a tibble, a dataframe that make working in the tidyverse easier. To explore gapminder, 
```{r}
structure(gapminder)
class(gapminder)
```
According class()function, the class of gapminder is a dataframe

To check number of columns and rows, we can use ncol() and nrow() functions. When using structure() in Console, it will also show: a tibble: 1704*6 that means there are 6 columns and 1704 rows.
```{r}
ncol(gapminder)
nrow(gapminder)
```
#Explore individual variables
To see the range of individual variables, we can use range(), for example:
```{r}
range(gapminder$pop) ## example of a quantitative variable
range()
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
